Question: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?
A: Let's think step by step
How many hours should they dedicate to the chapters? ** Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total.\nHow many hours should they dedicate to the worksheets? ** For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total.\nHow many days should they plan to study? ** Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 days.\nHow many minutes do they need to include for breaks? ** However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 extra minutes for breaks.\nHow many minutes do they need to include for snack breaks? ** They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes.\nHow many hours do they need to include for breaks and lunch? ** And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\nHow many hours do they want to plan? ** So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.\nHow many hours do they want to study each day? ** They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75\nHow many days do they need to plan? ** They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.
The answer is 4

Question: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?
A: Let's think step by step. How many units of each fruit did I buy? ** If 36 fruits were evenly split between 3 types of fruits, then I bought 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 units of each fruit\nHow much do 12 oranges cost? ** If 1 orange costs $0.50 then 12 oranges will cost $0.50 * 12 = $<<0.5*12=6>>6\nHow much did I spend on the other 2 fruit types? ** If my total bill was $66 and I spent $6 on oranges then I spent $66 - $6 = $<<66-6=60>>60 on the other 2 fruit types.\nHow much does 1 watermelon cost? ** Assuming the price of watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A\nHow much did we spend? ** If we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A\nHow much did we spend? ** Knowing that 1W=4A, then we can convert the above to $60 = 12(4A) + 12A\nHow much did we spend? ** $60 = 48A + 12A\nHow much did we spend? ** $60 = <<60=60>>60A\nHow much does one apple cost? ** Then we know the price of one apple (A) is $60/60= $<<60/60=1>>1.
